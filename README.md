In earning the [Linux+ Architecture](https://www.credly.com/badges/4910a7b1-647b-445f-8be6-9a7b1fa4e67c/public_urlv
) badge : 

There are many topics that were learned in achieving the architecture badge, And I will be going through them in more of a list style, with brief descriptions, I appreciate you taking the time to read my plethora of knowledge built through DA, If you have been reading other posts as well, I also appreciate you coming along with me through this journey, Stay Blessed :)

The first was learning basic Linux interactions, by logging into a command-line interface (CLI) Linux system and running some interactive commands such as elevating privileges, file management, tab completion and accessing the (man) manual pages for more help in regards to commands. 

Next up, we have a introduction to managing user accounts. I started with creating user accounts, within Linux, CentOS and Ubunto to perform basic tasks such as modifying comment fields to include user names and changing user default shells. I then explored how to remove user accounts, in which the home directory of one was preserved and the home directory of the other was not. 

I then continued on to managing group accounts, by doing nearly the same as managing user accounts, by creating some group accounts, then creating and adding users to the groups, displaying the group membership information, renaming groups and finally removing a group and checking the effect on members of that group. 

Moving on I then explored why it is important for Linux administrators to know how to configure and troubleshoot privilege escalation. For starters it is best practice for admins to avoid logging into root, to as not lead to accidental file deletion, misconfiguration or termination of services and many other irreversible actions. There are other ways to use root in more limited ways by first logging into a regular account and then elevating privileges, as required by using the su or the sudo command. By exploring and becoming familiar with the /etc/sudoers file, I was able to learn what control access the sudo command has.

Next let's take a peek at why Linux Admins should be proficient in understanding how to protect files and directories on a linux server by displaying and modifying linux permission using absolute or symbolic mode. First taking a look at existing permissions of a few files I then configured permissions for the file owner, the group, and all others for files and directories. 

It is also important to know how to configure special Linux permissions as a Linux admin, which also include SGID, the sticky bit and immutable flag. Especially in a scenario of employees of an organization being able to accidently delete or modify files pertaining to other groups or employees within an organization. By knowing special linux permissions the linux admin can adjust directories and files accordingly so situations like this don't happen.

Another feature of understanding permissions, is being able to configure access control lists, by doing so an admin can distribute specified permissions as needed for a single user in regards to directories or specific files, that are used by other departments within an organization.

We will wrap up the Architecture badge for Linux+ by acknowledging that one of the most useful skills as a admin, is having a foundational understanding to troubleshooting Linux permissions. The best way to become proficient with troubleshooting is having a general understanding of all the different permissions available and how to navigate them. From there, the more difficult scenarios one encounters and solves, will continue to grow and expand ones proficiency. Take each one, one breath at a time :) 

Thank you for making it this far, I hope that you may have pulled a few helpful ideas for you and your learning journey !

Best Wishes and Sincerely, 
Austin Barber
